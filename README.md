## IMDB-Recommender-System

I wrote this because I thought it was ridiculous that the TV series "Recess" did not appear in the search for "kid" in IMDB. 

This is a quick script that takes a keyword like "kid" (if you're looking for movies and TV series for kids), and does a semantic search on the IMDB database. And yes, Recess will appear now, along with many other better recommendations, in my opinion.

Just run the script in your term with an argument (your keyword):
python imdbrec.py kid
